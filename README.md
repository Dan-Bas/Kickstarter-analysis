# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

In this assessment are determining specific factors to analyze the successful of similar projects through kickstarter platform to set up the strategy to understand how to become an effective campaign for the play Fever.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For this analysis are taking the data from Kickstarter platform and extract only the data from the category theater. Then the info is organized by months in the Launch Date classification in order to determine what time of the year has more successful, failed and canceled projects. 

After reaching this approach the results are showing that the month of May has more activity and more outcomes as successful with 111 campaigns; the coming months have a decrease in successful campaigns but the failed campaigns are not correlative and those are sustained in the range of 40 to 50  per month. Also, the report shows that the month of December has the same amount between successful and canceled and the activity is quite low.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based Goals

In order to show an analysis for the Goals, the data is organized into ranges of amount of goals. Then, extract the outcomes based on successful, failed and canceled for each range. The ranges are sort from less than $1,000 and go from intervals of $5,000 until come to the last range which is more than $50,000. After sorting this info, are determining the percentages of each range per classification: Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled.

The results show that none of the project had canceled goals, there is a relative correlation between Successful and Failed projects and the less the goal is, the maximum of Percentage Successful is with 76%. Also, in the range of 45,000 to 49,999 is when less percentage of Successful projects are presented with 0% and the maximum of canceled projects are obtained with 100%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered    

The challenges encountered were in trying to organize the data in the format of months for the Outcomes Based in Launch Date due to the variety of years an therefore, in the beginning I did not find logic to organize only the months without mention the years because I have always thought that is a relative association to put all together the months of different years without knowing a complete story of a company, a project or an industry.

Another challenge was to convert the original dates in a format that can be read, the concept to apply a formula to convert numbers to dates was totally new for me and there was something that could be a potential challenge if the specifics of knowing that are missing.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. The month of May is the best month to launch a campaign with 111 Successful projects, also June and July seem to be good months with 100 and 87 Successful projects, respectively. 
  2. The month of December is the worst of the whole year with 37 Failed campaigns. In Addition, almost the same number of Failed projects are reported in that month with 35 outcomes. So is not recommended to launch a camping at the end of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  - The conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals is that there is a negative relation between the Percentage Successful and the Goal of the project. The less is the amount of the goal more is the Percentage of successful campaigns. As we see in the chart, in the range of “Less Than 1,000” the percentage of success is 76% and the range of “45,000 to 49,999” has 0%. The range of “Grater than 50,000” is one of the lowest in term of successful with 17% meanwhile the percentage of failed has 83%.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - One of the limitations I could find is that in the analysis Based on Launch Dates. All the years has no data for all months for example in 2010 there is data only for July October and December; for 2011 there is data only for March, April and December. This kind of limitations give me doubts about the analysis presented. Therefore, the affirmation about the month of May is the best to launch a campaign is really accurate?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - We can create tables and graphs based on countries, or the length of the projects in order to conclude different factors.
